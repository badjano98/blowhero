_SHORT_VERSION_

  A dildo with 5 "points of interest" to be triggered via tongue pressure, allowing the user to offer any connected device input by performing a blowjob, hopefully developing transferable skills and a healthy competitive spirit.
  The usage scenarios list is endless, check Devious-Devices' projects at cults3d.com for the idea that gave me this idea! 

_LONG_VERSION_

  This is a further developed version of the two projects:
https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/naughties/typing-talking-gag , https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/naughties/gagwriter-hands-free-keyboard by Devious-Devices.
  Instead of using long-shaft momentary push buttons, the prototype uses capacitive touch switches (TTP-223).
  These switches are positioned behind silicon, as to not be triggered by touching but only by pressing the silicon surface.
  The TTP-223s I used register changes in conductivity almost 10mm from the touch-plate, so each switch is positioned to have more than 10mm of silicon between touch-plate and the outer(user-side) silicon surface.
   A very useful feature of the TTP-223 is its automatic calibration at power-up, making variation in its enviroments conductivity (including the silicon and further device components) easily calibrated for by turning the device off and on again.
   Because of this the silicon sleeve has to be in place and undisturbed by the user when the device is turned on and while the switches are calibrating.
