_SHORT_VERSION_


_LONG_VERSION_
  This is a developed version of the two projects:
https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/naughties/typing-talking-gag , https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/naughties/gagwriter-hands-free-keyboard by Devious-Devices.
  Where these use long-shaft momentary push buttons, I used capacitive touch switches (TTP-223) placed behind silicon.
  Each switch has enough silicon seperating it from the outer surface for it to be "out of range". When a finger or tongue depresses the silicon entering the range of a switch and turns it ON, the switch signals this underlying program.
