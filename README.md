_SHORT_VERSION_
  A dildo with 5 "points of interest" to be triggered by pressure of the tongue, hopefully developing transferable skills and a healthy competitive outlook towards oral sex.

_LONG_VERSION_
  This is a further developed version of the two projects:
https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/naughties/typing-talking-gag , https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/naughties/gagwriter-hands-free-keyboard by Devious-Devices.
  Instead of using long-shaft momentary push buttons, the prototype uses capacitive touch switches (TTP-223). These switches are positioned behind silicon, as to not be triggered if you touch the dildo but only if the silicon is sufficiently depressed. This switch registers changes in conductivity a little less than 10mm from the touch-plate, so each switch is positioned to have 10+mm of silicon between the touch-plate and the outer(user-side) silicon surface.
   A very useful feature of the TTP-223 is its automatic calibration at power-up, making variation in its enviroment (inclluding the silicon and further device components) easily calibrated for by turning the device off and on again. This also means the device has to be turned on in the configuration it is going to be used, so the silicon sleeve and any condom/lubricant/accesory should be in place.
